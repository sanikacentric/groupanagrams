# 🔤 Group Anagrams

Python solution for grouping strings that are anagrams of each other — a hash map problem.

## 🎯 Problem

Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. Strings that are anagrams have the same characters in different order.

## 💡 Approach

- **Sorted Key HashMap** — O(n * k log k) using sorted string as dictionary key
- - **Character Count Key** — O(n * k) using character frequency tuple as key
